    "An **epoch** in machine learning ‚Äî especially in deep learning ‚Äî refers to **one complete pass through the entire training dataset** by the learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÅ Think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "If your training data has **1,000 samples**, and you train your model for **10 epochs**, it means the model will see each sample **10 times** ‚Äî once per epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Why do we need multiple epochs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single pass (1 epoch) is **usually not enough** for the model to learn meaningful patterns.\n",
    "- Each epoch helps the model adjust its weights slightly closer to the **optimal values**.\n",
    "- Multiple epochs allow the model to **gradually reduce error/loss** over time.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 1. **Batch Size**\n",
    "- Number of samples processed **before the model's weights are updated**.\n",
    "- Example: Batch size = 32 ‚Üí weights updated every 32 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Iterations**\n",
    "- Number of **batches** in one epoch.\n",
    "- Formula:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Iterations per epoch} = \\frac{\\text{Number of samples}}{\\text{Batch size}}\n",
    "  \\]\n",

    "\n",
    "### üß™ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1000 training samples\n",
    "# Batch size = 100\n",
    "# Epochs = 10\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterations per epoch = 1000 / 100 = 10\n",
    "# Total iterations = 10 epochs √ó 10 = 100\n",

    "### üîÑ What happens in one epoch?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data is divided into batches.\n",
    "2. For each batch:\n",
    "   - Forward pass (prediction).\n",
    "   - Loss is calculated.\n",
    "   - Backward pass (gradient computed).\n",
    "   - Weights are updated.\n",
    "3. After all batches are processed, **1 epoch is complete**.\n",

    "### üìâ When to stop training?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Usually you monitor the **validation loss** or accuracy.\n",
    "- Stop when validation performance stops improving (early stopping).\n",
    "- Training too long (too many epochs) ‚Üí **overfitting**.\n",
